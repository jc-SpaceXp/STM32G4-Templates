** STM32G4 Project Templates
Some basic project templates which are intended for the arm-none-eabi-gcc
toolchain. Does include support for unit tests if you wish to use them.
Otherwise remove the relevant dirs if you decide against testing. Look at
other branches for different setups e.g. FreeRTOS support, CMSIS support
instead of Libopencm3 etc.

The project itself is blinking the user LED on the STM32G431KB Nucleo
device.
